## HTML + Javascript + CSS
- I created a 5 question randomized coding quiz using HTML and Javascript, mainly styled with CSS
- User will be prompted by computer to answer 5 questions 
- If user does not answer correctly, computer will return text 'You got it wrong!'and button will turn red
- If user does answer correctly, computer will return 'You got it right!' and button will turn teal
- A timer with 60 seconds will display on top right and 10 seconds will be deducted from each wrong answer
- User will input intials at end of game and score + initials will be saved
